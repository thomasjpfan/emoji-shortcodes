# Streamlit emoji shortcodes this is another change

Below are all the emoji shortcodes supported by Streamlit.

Shortcodes are a way to enter emojis using pure ASCII. So you can type this `:smile:` to show this
:smile:.

(Keep in mind you can also enter emojis directly as Unicode in your Python strings too â€” you don't
*have to* use a shortcode.)
